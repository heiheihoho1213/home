# The Return of Brutalism

Web design is cyclical. After years of soft shadows, rounded corners, and frosted glass (looking at you, Apple)cdcsd, we are seeing a resurgence of **brutalism**.

## What is Neo-Brutalism?

It's not just about being ugly on purpose. It's about:
- High contrast
- Honest layout structures
- Default browser fonts (or weird ones)
- Visible borders

### Why now?
Users are tired of the "corporate memphis" art style. They want websites that feel authentic, raw, and perhaps a bit chaotic.

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs (but he probably wouldn't like this site).

## Conclusion
Embrace the ugly. Make it bold. Make it fast.
